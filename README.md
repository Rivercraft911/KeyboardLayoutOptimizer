# KeyboardLayoutOptimizer (KLO)

An intelligent keyboard layout optimizer that generates ergonomic keyboard layouts based on word frequency analysis and typing patterns.

## Project Status: Early Development

This project is currently in its initial development phase. We're focusing on:
- Setting up core data processing infrastructure
- Implementing basic layout generation algorithms
- Building visualization tools

## Description

KeyboardLayoutOptimizer analyzes word frequencies and letter patterns to generate keyboard layouts that optimize for:
- Common letter accessibility
- Reduced finger travel
- Efficient typing of frequent letter combinations
- Hand alternation
- Ergonomic finger movement

## Features (Planned)

- Word frequency analysis
- Bigram/trigram pattern recognition
- Layout optimization using genetic algorithms
- Visual heatmaps of finger movement and key usage
- Layout comparison tools
- Interactive layout visualization
- Layout export for various keyboard software

## Immediate Development Goals

1. Core Data Processing
   - Implement word frequency analysis
   - Set up bigram detection
   - Create basic scoring system

2. Basic Visualization
   - Keyboard layout renderer
   - Simple heatmap generation

3. Initial Optimization
   - Basic genetic algorithm implementation
   - Simple layout scoring
